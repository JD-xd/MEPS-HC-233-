Demographic Analysis Summary



**Context:**

This analysis uses the MEPS H233 dataset (~28,000 individuals, 1,500+ variables) to study the demographic distribution of the U.S. population sample.

Key dimensions include age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, income/poverty status, marital status, and employment. 



The objective was to understand how demographic factors shape healthcare access and outcomes.

**key Findings**

**Age Distribution:**

The population was primarily composed of adults (18–64 years), followed by children (<18) and elderly (65+).

Elderly individuals formed the 23% proportion but are the most healthcare-dependent group.

**Gender Breakdown:**

The dataset shows an almost even split between males and females, with a slightly higher share of females.

This aligns with population-level trends, where women are more likely to report healthcare utilization.

**Race \& Ethnicity:**

White, non-Hispanic individuals made up the largest share of respondents.

Hispanic and Black, non-Hispanic groups were also strongly represented, followed by Asian and Other categories.

This diversity enables subgroup analysis of healthcare disparities.

**Socioeconomic Status –**

**Poverty & Education:**

Respondents were classified into Poor, Near-Poor, Low-Income, Middle-Income, and High-Income groups.

The majority fell in middle-income and high-income categories, but a significant portion (Poor \& Near-Poor) reflects vulnerable groups with greater healthcare access challenges.

Education levels ranged from no schooling to Bachelor’s and above. Higher education correlated with higher income categories.

**Marital Status:**

Married individuals formed the largest group, followed by never married, with smaller shares of widowed, divorced, and separated

Marital status is important as it affects insurance coverage and healthcare decision-making.

**Employment:**

The majority of working-age respondents were employed, but notable groups were unemployed or not in the labor force.

Employment strongly aligns with insurance coverage and income security.

**Implications -**

The demographic structure reveals clear socioeconomic disparities: lower-income, less-educated, and unmarried individuals are more vulnerable to healthcare access challenges.

These groups are more likely to face gaps in insurance coverage and preventive care usage, which can translate into higher long-term costs.



**Policy relevance:** Programs targeting poor/near-poor groups, along with education-linked interventions, can help improve equity in healthcare access.
